## Outputs

After running, you will have:

### `parts_brain.sqlite`
A relational SQLite database containing every extracted part number, description, model, serial range, and source document.

### `parts_export.xlsx`
A human-readable export of the database, automatically split into multiple sheets if it exceeds Excel’s row limits.

The SQLite file is the authoritative **parts brain.**  
Excel is just a view.

## Commercial Use

This repository contains the open-core indexing engine.

Production datasets, OEM-normalized part libraries, distributor cross-references (for example TVH, OEM supersessions), and hosted deployments are available commercially.
