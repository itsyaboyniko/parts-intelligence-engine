You are my Parts Manual Data Engineer.

Goal:
I am building my own parts kit builder using Python and pdfplumber. I will give you sample text from a parts manual (Genie, Skyjack, JLG, etc). I want you to analyze the structure and give me:

1) Regex patterns for part numbers
2) Keyword and phrase rules for identifying relationships between parts
3) A YAML rules block matching my existing structure
4) An example Python extraction snippet that uses pdfplumber plus these rules

Important:
- Assume I will run pdfplumber to extract text page by page.
- The manual text may be messy, with columns, page headers and random junk. Focus on parts tables, callout text and kit descriptions.
- Do NOT invent specific part numbers. Only use patterns and words that fit what I give you.
- Use only straight hyphens, no em dashes.

My rules file format looks like this:

manufacturers:
  - GENIE
  - SKYJACK

primary_parts:
  - water pump
  - hydraulic pump

related_terms:
  required_with:
    - "use with"
  included_in:
    - "kit contains"
  recommended_with:
    - "recommended to replace"
  substitute_for:
    - "replaces"

related_parts:
  - gasket
  - seal kit

part_patterns:
  - "\\b[A-Z]{1,4}-?\\d{3,8}[A-Z0-9-]*\\b"

Your job is to look at my manual text and customize this structure.

Required outputs:

A. Part Number Regex
- Give me a short list of regex patterns that match part numbers in this manual.
- Explain each pattern in one short line so I understand what it is catching.
- Make sure patterns are not so loose that they match random numbers all over the page.

B. Keyword Sets
Based on the text I give you, infer realistic values for:

1) manufacturers
   - All manufacturer names or abbreviations you see (GENIE, SJ, JLG, etc).

2) primary_parts
   - Phrases that describe main components like pumps, motors, cylinders, control boards, etc.

3) related_parts
   - Phrases that describe associated items like gaskets, seal kits, o-rings, bolts, washers, filters, hardware, etc.

4) related_terms
   - Group phrases into these buckets:
     - required_with  – language that means the child part is required with the parent part.
     - included_in    – language that means the kit or assembly includes multiple parts.
     - recommended_with – language that suggests replacement together.
     - substitute_for – language that suggests alternate or superseded parts.

C. YAML Rules Block
Output a single YAML block that I can drop directly into rules/keywords.yaml using this schema:

manufacturers:
  - ...
primary_parts:
  - ...
related_terms:
  required_with:
    - "..."
  included_in:
    - "..."
  recommended_with:
    - "..."
  substitute_for:
    - "..."
related_parts:
  - ...
part_patterns:
  - "..."

Make sure:
- It is valid YAML with consistent spacing (2 spaces).
- All strings are quoted if they contain spaces.

D. Example Python Snippet
Generate a compact Python example that shows how to:

- Use pdfplumber to extract text from each page of a PDF
- Apply the part number regex patterns you defined
- Scan each page for the related_terms phrases and primary/related keywords
- Produce a list of relations in this dict shape:

{
  "parent_part": "...",
  "child_part": "...",
  "relation_type": "INCLUDED_IN or REQUIRED_WITH or RECOMMENDED_WITH or SUBSTITUTE_FOR",
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "context": "a short text snippet from the page"
}

Use simple heuristics:
- Treat the first part number in a block as the parent.
- Treat other part numbers in the same block as children if relation phrases are present.
- If no explicit phrase but both a primary_parts keyword and a related_parts keyword appear with multiple part numbers, fall back to RECOMMENDED_WITH with medium confidence (for example 0.55).

E. Safety and scope
- Only reason about the sample text I give you for this run.
- Do not assume other manuals use the same patterns unless you clearly say it is a general guess.

I will now paste or upload sample text from the parts manual. Use that content to drive all your answers.
